# Alterios MCP Project Status

Last updated: 2026-07-10

## Current Summary

The project has completed the foundation, multi-instance profile inventory,
read-only inventory expansion, script runtime catalog, controlled write gates,
and the first browser/UI discovery tooling slice.
First controlled live write practice has been completed on the `artx` test
project `4e247a6b-55ef-4665-b88c-3c156fee19ba`.
The ARTX project entity surface has been cataloged across metadata, UI,
runtime data, workflow, files, comments, users, and reports.
The ARTX sandbox metadata chain now exists as a reproducible practice script:
content type plus representative fields with dry-run, write gate, and readback.
The same practice script now covers the sandbox UI/data chain: table view,
view entity, view fields, add/edit/main forms, menu group, and one content row.
The same practice script now covers comment write/readback and a visible
`comments_list` UI block for the sandbox content row.
The same practice script now covers file-field upload, saved manual script
creation/execution, sandbox BPMN process/task completion, and dashboard report
create/update/full-readback.
Method coverage is now tracked explicitly: 51 MCP tools, 14 runtime services,
15 live read-only route probes, 57 REST route/method patterns, and 13 operation
classes.
Reinventory on 2026-07-10 confirmed the main product gap: ART X project base
has live evidence for views, forms, scripts, BPMN/process/task side effects,
files, comments, and reports. Typed-write expansion moved the MCP server from
4 write-like tools out of 23 total tools to 18 write-like tools out of 43 total
tools, then the metadata/data write expansion moved it to 23 write-like tools
out of 50 total tools. The dangerous-write safety pass added a read-only
preflight classifier and moved the MCP surface to 51 tools while keeping
write-like tools at 23.
The 2026-07-10 script/diagram/report research now records all observed script
types, all BPMN task-like nodes in the ART X project, and a second sandbox
dashboard report that proves Project Database source binding rules.
The report-in-tab UI experiment now embeds a data-bound sandbox report in the
edit form as a named tab with `params.openId=true`; API checks prove that
current-record view/report context should be verified as `dataId: [openId]`,
not `contentId` alone. The embedded viewer render itself remains open because
the in-app browser currently shows an empty `viewer_*` container even for the
static report.
The sandbox source view now has a third idempotent practice row so list views
and current-record scoping can be rechecked with more than the original two
rows.
Stimulsoft report work now has a dedicated layout/analytics playbook plus a
read-only geometry validator for template overlaps, page overflow, and
dynamic-height risks before saving or rendering reports.
Deep inventory now has reproducible scanners and live ART X matrices for
forms, form actions, scripts, BPMN links, process/task readback counts, and
iconId usage. The first repo-owned skill set now exists in `skills/` and uses
these matrices, docs, tools, tests, and live sandbox evidence as its source map.
The multi-agent operating contract now has a detailed task matrix for PM,
project-base inventory, material/data modeling, view building, form surfaces,
UI icons/actions, script/BPMN flows, Stimulsoft reports, write tools, safety
verification, and skill curation.
Repo-owned skills have now been forward-tested with read-only subagents,
improved from the findings, and installed into the local Codex skills directory
with absolute source-map references back to this repository.
Profile-level live smoke now has a reusable `alterios-profile-smoke` CLI,
MCP tool `alterios_profile_smoke_matrix`, and sanitized JSON/Markdown evidence
for configured Alterios instances.
Write-first metadata/data work now has typed MCP tools for content types,
fields, content create, menu groups, and helps, with dry-run diffs, explicit
profile/project targeting, write gate enforcement, managed-update guards, and
readback where the API returns an id.
Security/destructive flows now have a separate dangerous gate:
`alterios_write_safety_preflight`, `ALTERIOS_MCP_ALLOW_DANGEROUS_WRITE=1`, and
`allow_destructive=true` are required before generic REST/service execution can
reach destructive or permission-changing routes.
The multi-agent contract now includes Documentation Scribe / Писарь for
administrator and user instructions aligned with ГОСТ/ЕСПД and ГОСТ 34, using
the installed `gost-documentation-builder` skill and a local Alterios playbook.

| Practice. ARTX help sandbox write | Created `MCP Practice Sandbox` help entry in `artx` project `4e247a6b-55ef-4665-b88c-3c156fee19ba` through controlled generic REST write. | `bb89755` | Redacted profile check OK; readonly discovery 15/15 OK; dry-run audit OK; `POST /api/helps` executed with `ALTERIOS_MCP_ALLOW_WRITE=1`; API readback found id `2794b152-e1ca-4de2-9d3d-23b81a747d09`; browser UI showed title and body text. |
| Analysis. ARTX entity surface catalog | Documented the full project entity surface: counts, read/write routes, observed settings, risks, and write-practice order. | `f2cd8e5` | Live read-only inventory: 13 content types, 2522 fields, 21 views, 37 forms, 11 scripts, 3 diagrams, 144 contents, 1 task, 16 processes, 10 groups, 2 helps; `/api/features` and `/api/files` generic list routes returned 404; no write executed for this analysis. |
| Practice. ARTX metadata sandbox chain | Added reproducible `scripts/artx_practice_metadata.py`, created `MCP Practice. Песочница` content type and 6 fields through controlled REST writes. | `5d3e057` | Profile/project check OK; initial dry-run blocked fields until content type existed; `POST /api/content-types/save` created id `572aedf5-500f-4538-82be-ae2170ff174a`; `POST /api/fields/save` created 6 fields; readback confirmed actual mnames and `contentNameTemplate={{field_test__mcp_practice_mcp_practice_title}}`; final dry-run was idempotent with no planned writes. |
| Practice. ARTX UI/data sandbox chain | Extended `scripts/artx_practice_metadata.py` to create and verify view, view entity, view fields, add/edit/main forms, menu group, and one content row for the same sandbox. | `347841f` | Created view `cfd46277-d8da-4b7d-ba0e-7c96ea85046e`, forms `281442af-bb94-43a2-bc80-f5303c05d0fc`, `15f5fb26-5db4-4153-8131-23a54411cd63`, `3cfc70ab-3fb0-4567-8e25-7c863f0e87d0`, group `aa997c9a-d81e-4042-91c5-bafa90b32819`, content `bd51e83f-201e-4d53-bdc6-c4cd16754756`; `get-data-simplified` row_count=1; final dry-run was all `exists`; browser UI showed columns, add action, record, and date `10.07.2026`. |
| Analysis. Method coverage matrix | Added `docs/alterios-method-coverage.md` with counted MCP tools, runtime services, REST route/method patterns, operation classes, and live/cataloged/needs-HAR statuses. | `63cd9c3` | Counted from source: 22 MCP tools, 14 runtime services, 15 live readonly probes; registry now tracks 50 REST route/method patterns and 13 operation classes; explicitly marks comments/files/scripts/workflow/reports/security/destructive flows as not complete until sandbox/HAR/readback verification exists. |
| Practice. ARTX comments sandbox write | Added typed `alterios_add_comment`, extended `scripts/artx_practice_metadata.py`, and created one idempotent sandbox comment on the existing practice content row. | `65118a4` | Profile/project check OK; dry-run planned only `POST /api/v1/comments`; execution with `ALTERIOS_MCP_ALLOW_WRITE=1` created comment `7c8d6eb2-6a0b-4029-bbd9-63322bce1294` on content `bd51e83f-201e-4d53-bdc6-c4cd16754756`; final dry-run was all `exists` with `comment_found=true`, `comment_count=1`. |
| Practice. ARTX comments UI surface | Switched default comment scope to `entity=any`, added `comments_list` to the edit form, and verified native comments in the browser. | `167a558` | Dry-run planned edit-form update plus one `entity=any` comment; execution created comment `58988a37-8ddc-4839-83ea-c77e8f9876af`; browser card `MCP Practice. Карточка записи` showed block `Обсуждение`, author/date, and text `MCP Practice comment: comments write/readback coverage.`. |
| Practice. ARTX file/script/BPMN/report sandbox | Extended `scripts/artx_practice_metadata.py` to cover file-field upload, manual script creation/execution, BPMN diagram/process/task side effects, and dashboard report create/update/readback. | `12b8eb0` | Created file field `ea8d3e8c-b0cb-4eb8-9bb7-ad85acd8d7f2`; uploaded `mcp-practice-upload.txt` as file `c3cae956-296c-4f36-a966-cf5c0f3fc433`; created manual script `804e613a-19dd-4ea6-a0fc-a8fc118f6140` and executed it; created BPMN diagram `8ecdd2a7-23d4-40b2-b883-eb7c2ca19011`, started process `56051aa8-07a7-473d-a8ec-7c3a6beb26c0`, completed task `c989aa11-52bc-4f56-bb56-24f4a82afbf1`; created report `86ad4189-deaf-4744-96d5-6b1d22e73468` with Stimulsoft dashboard full readback; final dry-run was idempotent and browser main form showed `ФАЙЛ`, the sandbox row, and `MCP Practice sandbox report`. |
| Analysis. ARTX reinventory and MCP startup correction | Rechecked project base totals, MCP tool surface, startup shape, typed-write gaps, and agents/skills plan. Added `docs/reinventory-2026-07-10.md` and `docs/agents-and-skills.md`; updated README startup guidance to prefer `alterios-mcp.exe`. | `b1141bc` | Live profile smoke OK for `artx` and `vniimt`; live read-only discovery 15/15 OK for ART X project; project totals: 14 content types, 2529 fields, 22 views, 40 forms, 12 scripts, 4 diagrams, 145 contents, 17 processes, 1 report; MCP surface: 23 tools, 4 write-like tools. |
| Build. Typed content/file tools | Added `alterios_update_content_fields` and `alterios_file_upload_to_field` with preflight, dry-run diff, expected target checks, write gate, execution, file metadata readback, and content readback. | `aa06edb` | Unit tests for client/server write paths passed; ART X dry-run resolved sandbox content and file field; live `PATCH /api/contents/save` returned 200 and readback `field_test__mcp_practice_mcp_practice_verified=[true]`; live `/api/file/upload/field` returned 201 with file `5d3697d2-3bbb-48c4-960e-e1b312651978`; `/api/file/list` and practice dry-run confirmed `mcp-practice-upload.txt`. |
| Build. Typed view/form tools | Added `alterios_upsert_view`, `alterios_upsert_view_entity`, `alterios_upsert_view_field`, `alterios_upsert_form`, `alterios_patch_form_actions`, and `alterios_patch_form_tabs` with managed-marker guard, dry-run diff, write gate, execution, and readback. | `2c7fdae` | Unit tests for client/server write paths passed; `artx` profile check OK; live `dry_run=false` verified sandbox view `cfd46277-d8da-4b7d-ba0e-7c96ea85046e`, entity `f3e71cac-475a-479b-9242-d129b04e9746`, view field `b1a18bb6-12d9-4657-92d2-e4b0668cc065`, and form `3cfc70ab-3fb0-4567-8e25-7c863f0e87d0`; `get-data-simplified` returned `rows_len=1`; practice dry-run remained idempotent with view field count 8 and report/process/file checks still OK. |
| Build. Typed script/BPMN/report tools | Added `alterios_upsert_script`, `alterios_validate_script`, stronger `alterios_execute_manual_script`, `alterios_upsert_bpmn_diagram`, `alterios_start_process`, `alterios_list_process_tasks`, `alterios_complete_task`, `alterios_validate_process_result`, `alterios_upsert_report`, `alterios_patch_report_template`, and `alterios_validate_report_project_base`. | `d54e1d1` | Unit/full tests passed; `artx` profile check OK; live `dry_run=false` verified script upsert, manual script execution, BPMN diagram upsert, process start, task completion, report upsert/template patch, and Project Database validation. Final live process start returned task and completion status 200; process validation returned `completed_matches=true`; report validation returned dashboard page, Project Database, marker match, view name match, and `view_row_count=1`; practice dry-run remained consistent with `process_count=3`, active `task_count=0`, report full readback, and view data row_count 1. |
| Research. Scripts, BPMN tasks, and report source rules | Added `docs/script-diagram-report-research-2026-07-10.md` with live script type inventory, every parsed BPMN task node, and rules for connecting Stimulsoft reports to Project Database view sources. | `d317c0d` | Live `artx` inventory: 12 scripts (`manual=9`, `event=2`, `diagram=1`), 4 diagrams, 5 `userTask`, 1 `scriptTask`, 12 sequence flows; created report `35b6bdbe-f4ae-4ec1-99e9-c23db4df4543`; validation returned dashboard page, Project Database, marker match, view-name match, and `view_row_count=1`. |
| Research. Report tab openId UI rules | Updated the sandbox edit form with a named report tab and `params.openId=true`; added a second sandbox content row to prove context scoping. Documented the rules in `docs/report-tab-openid-ui-research-2026-07-10.md`. | `8af5aaf` | Live `artx` update: edit form `15f5fb26-5db4-4153-8131-23a54411cd63` has `Отчет openId`; control row `b69e914d-9250-4672-ac81-047fdce887f8` created; no-context view data returned 2 rows, `contentId` returned 2 rows, `dataId=[openId]` returned 1 row; browser UI showed the tab and rendered `MCP Practice sandbox report`. |
| Research. Data-bound openId report API template | Added a separate Codex-managed report `MCP Practice. OpenId Bound Report` and wired the edit-form report tab to it. The template uses Project Database and references the source view title column for current-row output. | `0f61a68` | Live `artx` write created/updated report `49236112-3335-4ca4-9a85-7f2236f6365a`; readback confirmed dashboard page, Project Database source, title-field reference, and `edit_form_openid_report_tab=true`; `get-data` with `dataId=[openId]` still returns 1 row. Browser recheck found the embedded report viewer container empty for both static and data-bound reports, so visual proof remains open. |
| Practice. Additional sandbox content row | Added a third idempotent practice row to the ARTX sandbox source view for list, UI, and `dataId` scoping verification. | `a179010` | Created content `9a504330-5ce4-4a76-9043-bbc2fc293e3c`; dry-run readback reports `content_count=3`; `get-data` without context returns 3 rows, `contentId=<additional>` returns 3 rows, and top-level `dataId=[additional]` returns 1 row; browser main form shows all 3 rows, score `42`, and pagination `1-3 / 3`. |
| Build. Stimulsoft layout and analytics guardrails | Added a Russian playbook for printable forms, dashboard analytics, and Alterios Project Database rules; added `alterios_validate_stimulsoft_layout` plus `alterios-stimulsoft-layout-check`. | `80c495d` | Unit tests cover clean layout, visible overlap, page overflow, and dynamic-height risks; full `pytest`: 87 passed; `git diff --check` OK; read-only live check on reports `86ad4189-deaf-4744-96d5-6b1d22e73468` and `49236112-3335-4ca4-9a85-7f2236f6365a` returned 0 layout issues. |
| Build. Form surface UX guardrails | Added `alterios_analyze_form_surface`, `alterios-form-surface-check`, and `docs/form-surface-ux-and-icons.md`. The premature repo-owned skill was removed until deep inventory evidence is complete. | `cd09639` | Unit tests cover clean view row, empty slot/source errors, row action order, missing icons, roles, styles, and report source inventory. |
| Research. Form + Script/BPMN + Icons deep inventory | Added `alterios-deep-inventory`, live ART X form matrix, script/BPMN linkage matrix, icon usage matrix, and UTF-8 icon standard copy. | `fb98c14` | Live read-only run on `artx` project found 40 forms, 47 cells, 74 actions, 12 scripts, 4 diagrams, 8 BPMN form links, 7 form-script links, and 121 icon usages; read errors: 0. |
| Design. Agent task matrix | Expanded `docs/agents-and-skills.md` into a concrete multi-agent task contract and synced `docs/roadmap.md` with the expanded role set. | `703e593` | `pytest`: 95 passed; `git diff --check` OK; docs secret scan found only public write-gate variable names. |
| Build. Repo-owned skill set | Added the first 8 repo-owned Alterios skills under `skills/`, each with `SKILL.md`, `agents/openai.yaml`, and `references/source-map.md`; added structure tests and documented the set in README/agents docs. | `d664588` | Skill Creator `quick_validate`: 8/8 valid; `pytest`: 97 passed; `git diff --check` OK; skills/docs secret scan clean; two read-only subagents reviewed references, required rules, duplication risks, and acceptance checks. |
| Build. Skill forward-test and installer | Added `scripts/install_repo_skills.py`, installer tests, install documentation, forward-test report, PM inventory template, and skill improvements from three read-only subagent scenarios; installed the 8 skills into `C:\Users\admin\.codex\skills`. | `85acdc7` | Skill Creator `quick_validate`: repo 8/8 valid and installed 8/8 valid; `pytest`: 100 passed; installer dry-run reports 8 `skip` after install; installed source maps have no `../../../` paths. |
| Build. Profile-level smoke matrix | Added `alterios-profile-smoke`, MCP tool `alterios_profile_smoke_matrix`, unit tests, README guidance, and sanitized live evidence in `docs/profile-smoke-matrix-2026-07-10.*`. | `c90963f` | Live read-only smoke: 2 profiles, project lists OK for both, 53 projects total, default-project route discovery 15/15 OK for both, write gate false; `pytest`: 103 passed; `git diff --check` OK; artifact secret/URL/UUID scan clean. |
| Build. Typed metadata/data write tools | Added `alterios_list_content_types`, `alterios_upsert_content_type`, `alterios_upsert_field`, `alterios_create_content`, `alterios_upsert_group`, and `alterios_upsert_help`. | `512cd55` | `pytest`: 111 passed; `git diff --check` OK; `py_compile` OK; changed-file secret scan clean; no live write executed. |
| Build. Dangerous write safety gate | Added `alterios_write_safety_preflight`, security-route classification, `ALTERIOS_MCP_ALLOW_DANGEROUS_WRITE=1`, dangerous gate audit visibility, PATCH support for generic REST writes, and profile-smoke gate reporting. | `70bc301` | `pytest`: 115 passed; `git diff --check` OK; `py_compile` OK; changed-file secret scan clean; no live write executed. |
| Design. Documentation Scribe agent | Added Documentation Scribe / Писарь to the multi-agent matrix and created `docs/gost-documentation-scribe-agent.md` for ГОСТ-oriented administrator/user instructions. | `6b19685` | `pytest`: 115 passed; `git diff --check` OK; changed-file secret scan clean; no live write executed. |

## Active Stage

| Stage | Status | Owner | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| 11. Security/destructive sandbox evidence | Next | Lead Engineer + Safety Verifier + Write Tools Agent | Use read-only UI/HAR/API evidence plus `alterios_write_safety_preflight` to map exact users/roles/delete routes before adding any typed destructive or permission-changing tool. |

## Backlog

| Priority | Task | Status | Notes |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | Add typed content/file tools: `alterios_update_content_fields` and `alterios_file_upload_to_field`. | Done | Implemented and live-verified against existing `MCP Practice` sandbox with preflight read, expected target check, dry-run diff, execution gate, file metadata readback, and content readback. |
| 1 | Add typed metadata/data create tools for content types, fields, content rows, groups, and helps. | Done | Implemented with dry-run diff, explicit `profile/project_id`, write gate, managed-update guard, target mismatch checks, and readback where the API returns an id. Unit-tested without live writes. |
| 1 | Add separate dangerous write gate for security/destructive flows. | Done | `alterios_write_safety_preflight` classifies generic REST routes; `alterios_rest_write` and destructive services now require both `ALTERIOS_MCP_ALLOW_WRITE=1` and `ALTERIOS_MCP_ALLOW_DANGEROUS_WRITE=1` plus `allow_destructive=true` for dangerous execution. |
| 1 | Add typed view/form tools. | Done | Implemented and live-verified against `MCP Practice. Список` plus the main MCP Practice form with managed-marker guard, dry-run diff, write gate, execution, and readback. |
| 1 | Add typed script/BPMN/report tools. | Done | Implemented and live-verified against `MCP Practice` sandbox with script upsert/manual execution, BPMN diagram upsert, process start/task complete, report save/template patch, Project Database validation, and source view readback. |
| 1 | Capture browser/UI network-flow workflow for uncovered operation classes. | In Progress | File/script/BPMN/report paths now have API sandbox coverage; report-in-tab form wiring is browser-visible; remaining capture priority is destructive/security flows and renderer diagnostics for the empty embedded report viewer. |
| 1 | Build sandbox data chain: content type -> fields -> form -> view -> content record. | Done | Completed in ARTX sandbox; comments, files, manual scripts, BPMN/process/task side effects, and reports are now covered. |
| 2 | Build deep form/script/BPMN/icon inventory before skills. | Done | Added `alterios-deep-inventory` plus `docs/form-surface-inventory.*`, `docs/script-bpmn-linkage.*`, `docs/icon-usage-matrix.json`, and `docs/alterios-icon-standards.md`. |
| 2 | Add repo-owned agents and skills scaffolding after deep inventory. | Done | First pass created 8 skills with source maps, OpenAI metadata, structure tests, and Skill Creator validation. |
| 2 | Forward-test and install repo-owned skills. | Done | Three read-only subagent scenarios covered inventory/PM, form/icons/BPMN, and write/report/safety; installer copies skills to the local Codex skills dir and rewrites installed source maps to absolute repo paths. |
| 2 | Add Documentation Scribe / Писарь agent for ГОСТ-oriented instructions. | Done | Added docs-only agent, local playbook, handoff format, and documentation pipeline. It reuses installed `gost-documentation-builder` instead of creating a duplicate repo-owned skill. |
| 2 | Expand Stimulsoft validator with rendered PDF/image comparison once export/render tooling is available. | Next | Current validator is static preflight; final acceptance still needs Stimulsoft render/UI proof. |
| 2 | Add profile-level live smoke matrix across multiple Alterios instances. | Done | `alterios-profile-smoke` and `alterios_profile_smoke_matrix` record sanitized profile/project coverage; live 2026-07-10 run covered `artx` and `vniimt` with 15/15 default-project route smoke each. |
| 2 | Add plan binding or expected target IDs for execution after dry-run review. | Deferred | Useful before production typed write execution. |
| 2 | Improve static scanner context classification (`matched_by`, confidence, callee kind). | Deferred | Stage 3 keeps false positives unknown; deeper classification is separate scanner work. |
| 3 | Release packaging and changelog process. | Deferred | Start after controlled writes are stable. |

## Current Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Runtime service endpoint compatibility is blocked in the current `vniimt` config because the endpoint template is `/api/scripts/execute-manual`. | Keep runtime service names cataloged only; do not treat them as executable through manual-script UUID endpoint. |
| Generic write tools can mutate production Alterios projects if deliberately executed. | Keep dry-run as default, require explicit `profile`, explicit `project_id`, `ALTERIOS_MCP_ALLOW_WRITE=1`, and `dry_run=false`; dangerous routes additionally require `ALTERIOS_MCP_ALLOW_DANGEROUS_WRITE=1` and `allow_destructive=true`. |
| Remaining risky surfaces are security/destructive flows, not normal project-base builders. | Keep users/roles/destructive deletes behind read-only evidence, `alterios_write_safety_preflight`, typed target checks, explicit dangerous gate, and UI/readback verification. |
| Many Alterios endpoints are project-scoped even when they look generic. | Continue treating profile as instance and `project_id` as explicit call context. |
| Browser/UI flow tooling has not yet captured a live Alterios scenario in this session. | Keep Stage 5 open; capture only in scratch/test context and commit sanitized artifacts after redaction checks. |
| Embedded report viewer currently renders an empty `viewer_*` container in the in-app browser, including for the static report that previously rendered. | Treat report template/API readback as verified, but keep data-bound report visual proof open until renderer/network behavior is diagnosed and the static report renders again. |
| Generic REST write remains a broad escape hatch for route shapes not yet modeled as typed tools. | Prefer typed metadata/data, content/file, view/form, script/BPMN/task, and report tools; keep generic writes for deliberate one-off discovery with explicit gates and readback. |

## Next Concrete Actions

1. Capture read-only UI/HAR/API evidence for users/roles/delete routes and run
   `alterios_write_safety_preflight` for each candidate before any typed tool is
   added.
2. Prepare source maps for administrator and user instructions: verified setup
   commands, MCP startup, profile configuration, write gates, common workflows,
   screenshots needed, and unresolved facts.
3. Expand Stimulsoft validator with rendered PDF/image comparison once export
